In this section we will tell how you can get free devnet NZTs on Nexis Devnet for testing / building dApps:

<CardGroup>

  <Card title="Native NZT" icon="terminal" href="#sending-tokens-to-native-address">
   Native currency of Nexis Native chain
  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM NZT" icon="link" href="#sending-tokens-to-evm-address">
   Native currency of EVM layer of Nexis Network
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={1}>

  <Card title="Command Line Interface" icon="terminal" href="/quickstart">
   Nexis CLI should be installed for claiming tokens on Native Chain
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Airdrop on Native Chain
To claim free devnet tokens on Nexis Network Devnet Native chain

Set Nexis Network Devnet RPC url in the Nexis config
```bash
nexis config set --url https://evm-devnet.nexis.network
```

```bash
nexis airdrop 10
```

You can also bridge these tokens to EVM Devnet

```bash
nexis evm transfer-to-evm 0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189 10
```

## Airdrop on Nexis Network EVM (Devnet)
You can not airdrop EVM tokens directly from Nexis CLI but you can bridge them by requesting them on [Native Chain](#airdrop-on-native-chain)

You can use [Devnet Faucet UI](https://evm-faucet-devnet.nexscan.io) for claiming Devnet tokens by entering your EVM Address
