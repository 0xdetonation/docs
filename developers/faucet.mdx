In this section we will tell how you can get free devnet NZTs on Nexis Devnet for testing / building dApps:

<CardGroup>

  <Card title="Native NZT" icon="terminal" href="#sending-tokens-to-native-address">
   Native currency of Nexis Native chain
  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM NZT" icon="link" href="#sending-tokens-to-evm-address">
   Native currency of EVM layer of Nexis Network
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={1}>

  <Card title="Command Line Interface" icon="terminal" href="/quickstart">
   Nexis CLI should be installed for claiming tokens on Native Chain
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Sending tokens to Native Address
To send transaction to any native address you need address of recipient and the amount to transfer.

```bash
$ nexis transfer
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
    <AMOUNT>

USAGE:
    nexis transfer <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --config <FILEPATH>

For more information try --help
```

For example: Sending `10 NZTs` to `Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK`

```bash
nexis transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10
```

If the recipient doesn't have any tokens, then you will need to pass an additional flag with the above command, like this 

```bash
nexis transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10 --allow-unfunded-recipient
```

## Sending tokens to EVM Address
To send transaction to any evm address you need address of recipient and the amount to transfer.

For example: Sending `10 NZTs` to `0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189`

```bash
nexis evm transfer-to-evm 0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189 10
```
