In this section we will explain how you can use Nexis CLI to make:

   Transfering native NZT tokens
  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM Transactions" icon="link" href="#nexis-zkevm-testnet">
   Bridging/Sending to EVM Address
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites

   Nexis CLI should be installed
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Sending tokens to Native Address
To send transaction to any native address you need address of recipient and the amount to transfer.

```bash
$ nexis transfer
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
    <AMOUNT>

USAGE:
    nexis transfer <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --config <FILEPATH>

For more information try --help
```

For example: Sending `10 NZTs` to `Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK`

```bash
nexis transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10
```

If the recipient doesn't have any tokens, then you will need to pass an additional flag with the above command, like this 

```bash
nexis transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10 --allow-unfunded-recipient
```
